## **About**

99 Cards is a real-time tactic card game where players have no direct control over their units. Instead, both allied and enemy units are both controlled by AI and the players are given a set of cards to indirectly influence units and change the flow of the battle in their favour. The charm of the game lies in trying to manipulate the AI and watch everything unfold according to plan.

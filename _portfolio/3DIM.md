## **About**

3D Interactive Map also known as 3DIM, is a solution for people who have trouble reading 2D maps or are directionally challenged. The idea is companies that manage popular location with complicated layout (theme park, shopping centre, tourist hotspot and etc.) would set up Virtual Reality (VR) booth around those location with 3DIM boot up on it. The end user would then select their destination and they will take a short ride on the VR headset towards their location. Our argument is that if the person were to experience going there at least once in person (or in this case in VR) they would not have that much trouble getting there again.

## **Who Did It?**
3DIM is a 2 man student project (GAT 399 Module) done by Treven Tan and [Austin John Hernandez](https://austinjrh.wixsite.com/portfolio).

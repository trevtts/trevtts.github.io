Hi! My name is Treven Tan and I am a Game Developer based in Singapore.  

I am a 3rd year undergraduate studying at DigiPen Institute of Technology Singapore studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Game Design, expected to graduate in May 2021.  

Feel free to check out this website as it will contain details [about me](about.md) and [projects](projects.md) that I have done. The website will not only contain all my previous student project, but will also contain some of my [personal post](mypost.md) too.
